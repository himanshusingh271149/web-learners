<h2>PHP Tutorial</h2>
<p>The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is a programming language that allows web developers to create dynamic content that interacts with databases. PHP is basically used for developing web based software applications. This tutorial helps you to build your base with PHP.
</p> 
<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>This tutorial is designed for PHP programmers who are completely unaware of PHP concepts but they have basic understanding on computer programming.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
Before proceeding with this tutorial you should have at least basic understanding of computer programming, Internet, Database, and MySQL etc is very helpful.
</p>
<h2>Execute PHP Online</h2>
<p>


For most of the examples given in this tutorial you will find Try it an option, so just make use of this option to execute your PHP programs at the spot and enjoy your learning.

Try following example using Try it option available at the top right corner of the below sample code box -
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Online PHP Script Execution&lt;/title&gt;    
   &lt;/head&gt;
   
   &lt;body&gt;
      
      &lt;?php
         echo "&lt;h1&gt;Hello, PHP!&lt;/h1&gt;";
      ?&gt;
   
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></code>
</p>
<h2>PHP - Introduction</h2>
<p>PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.

PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".

PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.

It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.

PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.

PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time.

PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible.

PHP Syntax is C-Like.
</p>
<h2>Common uses of PHP</h2>

PHP performs system functions, i.e. from files on a system it can create, open, read, write, and close them.

PHP can handle forms, i.e. gather data from files, save data to a file, through email you can send data, return data to the user.

You add, delete, modify elements within your database through PHP.

Access cookies variables and set cookies.

Using PHP, you can restrict users to access some pages of your website.

It can encrypt data.
<h2>"Hello World" Script in PHP</h2>
<p>
To get a feel for PHP, first start with simple PHP scripts. Since "Hello, World!" is an essential example, first we will create a friendly little "Hello, World!" script.

As mentioned earlier, PHP is embedded in HTML. That means that in amongst your normal HTML (or XHTML if you're cutting-edge) you'll have PHP statements like this -
</p>
<h2></h2>
<p><pre><code>
&lt;html&gt;
   
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;?php echo "Hello, World!";?&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>
It will produce following result -

Hello, World!
</p>
<p>If you examine the HTML output of the above example, you'll notice that the PHP code is not present in the file sent from the server to your Web browser. All of the PHP present in the Web page is processed and stripped from the page; the only thing returned to the client from the Web server is pure HTML output.

All PHP code must be included inside one of the three special markup tags ate are recognised by the PHP Parser.
In order to develop and run PHP Web pages three vital components need to be installed on your computer system.

Web Server - PHP will work with virtually all Web Server software, including Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) but then most often used is freely available Apache Server. Download Apache for free here - https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

Database - PHP will work with virtually all database software, including Oracle and Sybase but most commonly used is freely available MySQL database. Download MySQL for free here - https://www.mysql.com/downloads/

PHP Parser - In order to process PHP script instructions a parser must be installed to generate HTML output that can be sent to the Web Browser. This tutorial will guide you how to install PHP parser on your computer.
</p>
<h2>PHP Parser Installation</h2>
<p>Before you proceed it is important to make sure that you have proper environment setup on your machine to develop your web programs using PHP.

Type the following address into your browser's address box.

http://127.0.0.1/info.php
If this displays a page showing your PHP installation related information then it means you have PHP and Webserver installed properly. Otherwise you have to follow given procedure to install PHP on your computer.

This section will guide you to install and configure PHP over the following four platforms -

PHP Installation on Linux or Unix with Apache

PHP Installation on Mac OS X with Apache

PHP Installation on Windows NT/2000/XP with IIS

PHP Installation on Windows NT/2000/XP with Apache

Apache Configuration
If you are using Apache as a Web Server then this section will guide you to edit Apache Configuration Files.

Just Check it here - PHP Configuration in Apache Server

PHP.INI File Configuration
The PHP configuration file, php.ini, is the final and most immediate way to affect PHP's functionality.

Just Check it here - PHP.INI File Configuration

Windows IIS Configuration
To configure IIS on your Windows machine you can refer your IIS Reference Manual shipped along with IIS.
