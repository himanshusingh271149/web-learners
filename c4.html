<h2>Why Study JavaScript?</h2>
<p>
JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages

   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

This tutorial is about JavaScript, and how JavaScript works with HTML and CSS.
<h2>Did You Know?</h2>
<p>
JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.

You can read more about the different JavaScript versions in the chapter JS Versions.

<h2>JavaScript References</h2>
<p>W3Schools maintains a complete JavaScript reference, including all HTML and browser objects.

The reference contains examples for all properties and methods, and is continuously updated according to the latest web standards.

<h2>JavaScript Can Change HTML Content</h2>
<p>
One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().

This example uses the method to "find" an HTML element (with id="demo") and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript":
Example
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";
</p>
<h2>JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)</h2>
<p>
Changing the style of an HTML element, is a variant of changing an HTML attribute:

Example
document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "25px";
or
document.getElementById('demo').style.fontSize = '25px';
